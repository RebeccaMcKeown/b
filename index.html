        <div class="container box2"<p>Hi, I'm Rebecca and this website is going to talk about beatboxing.
        
        I got into beatboxing in 2015 the video to the left blew my little mind. I've been following the scene and messing around with beatboxing myself every since.

        This event and this performance was a pivotal moment in the beatbox scene as a whole, and even though it's 6 years old and beatboxing has come a long way even in that time, it's still a video I'd recommend a newcomer watch.

        There's a lot I could say about it but from now on I'll try and keep things at least a little bit informative rather than just gushing about all my favourite battles :P
