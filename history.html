        <div class="container box2"<p>Modern beatboxing was pioneered in the 1980s by hip-hop artists such as Doug E Fresh, Biz Markie, and Darren "Buffy" Robinson. Many of the techniques involved go back much further though, and beatboxing has both directly drawn from these areas and indepentently developed similar techniques. Body percussion is seen in all sorts of music, and is a major part of African traditional music in particular. Vocal bass techniques draw influences from Tuvan throat singing. It's easy to draw a line between jazz scat singing and the "boots 'n' cats" of beatboxing. Musical performances in beatboxing span a wide range of genres, reaching into dubstep, drum & bass techno, pop, and even metal and punk. Beatboxers are constantly pushing the boundaries of whatn you can do with the human vocie.
            
        The term "beatbox" refers to a drum machine, so a "human beatbox" is a person replicating the sounds of a drum machine. Doug E Fresh takes credit for coining the term "human beatbox", though its exact origin is unclear. Nowadays you usally just hear the term "beatboxer". </p></div>

        <div class="container box2"<p>Beatboxing was to an extent born out of necessity, originating in poor black neighborhoods in the USA at a time when drum machines were very expensive and inaccessible. Part of the joy of beatboxing is that doesn't need any equipment and the technical barrier for entry is so low; if you can make sounds with your mouth you can beatbox. You can experiment with it at any time, walking down the street or sitting around at home.<br><br>
        Beatboxing, especially in its earlieest days, is deeply intertwined with the hip-hop scene, and as such battles are an integral part of the community and the artform itself. Innovation is driven heavily by battles in the underground scene, with regular, direct competition constantly pushing beatboxers to improve. Even today, most beatboxers became known and shaped themselves through battling. Rahzel and Kenny Muhammad.</p></div>

        <div class="container box2"<p>Today beatboxing is going as strong as ever. Techniques are being invented and refined all the time, new forms of musicality are being experimented with. Events are hosted all over the world, and though it is still a relatively niche community, it's having more and more influence in the mainstream. Beatboxers are getting interviews on mainstream TV, getting parts in movies, and competing in major talent shows.</p></div>
